# Rails Girls Application

This repository contains a Rails application which consists of various parts
covered in a typical Rails Girls workshop - a static page and a few scaffolds.

## Getting started

To get this application running, you need to follow the [installation guide](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install)
found on Rails Girls website, if you haven't installed any of the tools
during your workshop. After you complete the process, make sure you [setup git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

#### Forking a repository

If you would like to get this project running on your own or use it as a
staring point for some experimentation, read [how to _fork_ a repository
and _clone_ it locally on your computer](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

#### Running commands

Don't forget you need to run `rake db:migrate` after running `rails generate
scaffold` or `rails generate model`.

#### Updating the design

If you want to update your application design, check out [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)
and this short [Rails Girls tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/design) on
how to implement it.
